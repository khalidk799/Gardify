## Description of the project :
Everyone wants a beautiful lush garden in their house either for refreshment or as a hobby, but when it comes to taking care of the plants, not everyone is a professional, we often overwater our plants or end up with a dried one. To tackle these issues, we have created an app where Crawler the worm provides proper guidance on how to take care of various plants. This app provides all the information and direction you need for taking care of your favorite greens for how to plant them to their nourishment. We have also listed some of the best sites for buying plant-related products.

1. Provides all the details from the initial level - how to plant, water needs, sunlight needs, and all other required information.
2. Listing of some good websites for buying plant products.
3. Cross-platform application.
4. Has various methods to make DIY manures.
5. User friendly 
6. Has details of all plant types
7. Has a discussion platform for connecting with other plant lovers.

## Advantages :
1. Promotes organic gardening
2. Make gardening easy and fun
3. Promotes self gardening, which has a positive effect on mental and physical health.
4. It brings good websites selling greens to peopleâ€™s view
